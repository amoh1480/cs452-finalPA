Create a folder named code_solution with the GIT repository.  Place your exact solution and approximate solution in this folder including a README file that provides instructions and exact commands to run your code.  Within the code_solution folder, create a test_cases folder that contains all test cases.  Create a shell script named run_test_cases.sh that executes your program on all test cases.
