# RUNNING 
To run these scripts, simply do 

```shell
sh run_test_cases.sh
```

in the command line to run all three scripts. Each script generates an output file(s), and they are stored in the /code_solution/output_files folder.
To run each script individually, simply do as before but choose the script that you want to run! For our group, we have: 
- `./ozi_test_cases.sh` that runs Ozi's approximate test cases
- `./exact_test_cases.sh` that runs Abdullah's exact test cases
- `./run_test_cases.sh` runs Elvis' (but consequently runs all three)
